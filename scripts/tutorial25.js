/**
 * Module syntax - ES2015
 * Module Loading - WIP
 *
 * npm install es6-module-loader traceur systemjs
 * going to  use tracer as a transpiler instead
 * of typescript
 * why? -> when we are dealing with modules there 2 things to
 * keep in mind, 1st one is the modules syntax
 * and module loading -> once we have the mods we need to load
 * onto our browser, now for this there is no std yet and a work in progress
 * at this pt of time, it dosen't matter if you use tracer, babble, or typescript
 * tracer much more simpler
 *
 * what is the initla set up, create a folder
